The `bladeRF 2.0 micro xA4` is a versatile Software Defined Radio (SDR) designed for both high performance and mobile applications. It operates across a wide frequency range of 47 MHz to 6 GHz, supports a sampling rate of 61.44 MSPS, and offers 2×2 Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) streaming. This makes it suitable for a variety of wireless communication projects. 

**Key Features:**

- **Frequency Range:** 47 MHz to 6 GHz
- **Sampling Rate:** 61.44 MSPS
- **MIMO Support:** 2×2 MIMO streaming
- **FPGA:** Equipped with an Intel (formerly Altera) Cyclone V FPGA, offering 49,000 Logic Elements (LEs), with approximately 32,000 LEs available for user programming. 
- **USB Interface:** Utilizes USB 3.0 SuperSpeed for high-speed, low-latency data transfer.
- **Software Compatibility:** Compatible with various platforms, including GNU Radio, GQRX, SDR-Radio, SDR#, gr-fosphor, and SoapySDR, across Windows, Linux, and macOS. 

**Additional Features:**
