## Division of roles (between the OAI PHY layer and the RF board)

When using **BladeRF** with **OpenAirInterface (OAI)**, the division of roles between the OAI PHY layer and the RF board (and specifically the FPGA on the RF board) is as follows:

---

### **OAI PHY Layer Role**
The OAI PHY layer processes the baseband signal, which includes modulation, channel coding, and any other baseband signal processing functions necessary for the LTE or 5G signal. 

1. **Transmit Path:**
   - The PHY layer generates **IQ samples** for transmission after tasks such as:
     - **Channel Coding**: Turbo codes (LTE) or LDPC (5G NR).
     - **Modulation**: QPSK, 16QAM, or 64QAM symbols.
     - **OFDM Modulation**: Adding cyclic prefixes and generating time-domain samples through the IFFT.
     - **Beamforming (if applicable)**: Applying weights to IQ streams for directional transmission.

2. **Receive Path:**
   - The PHY layer processes the received **IQ samples** after the RF board has converted the analog signal to digital:
     - **OFDM Demodulation**: Removing the cyclic prefix and performing FFT to retrieve frequency-domain data.
     - **Channel Estimation and Equalization**: Correcting for channel effects using pilot symbols (e.g., DMRS).
     - **Demodulation**: Extracting bits from QPSK/16QAM/64QAM symbols.
     - **Channel Decoding**: Turbo or LDPC decoding to retrieve the final bit stream.

### **RF Board Role (BladeRF FPGA and RF Frontend)**
The RF board's **FPGA** handles the tasks that interface between the digital baseband signal and the RF domain. These tasks typically include:

1. **Transmit Path:**
   - **Digital Upsampling and Filtering**: The IQ samples from the OAI PHY layer are interpolated and filtered for transmission.
   - **Digital-to-Analog Conversion (DAC)**: Converts the digital IQ samples to an analog signal.
   - **RF Upconversion**: Mixes the analog baseband signal to the desired RF frequency for over-the-air transmission.

2. **Receive Path:**
   - **RF Downconversion**: Converts the received RF signal from the carrier frequency to baseband.
   - **Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)**: Converts the analog baseband signal to digital IQ samples.
   - **Digital Downsampling and Filtering**: Decimates and filters the digital samples before sending them to the OAI PHY layer.

3. **Clock Synchronization**: Ensures tight timing control for sample rates and carrier frequencies, often with GPS or external clocks for synchronization in testbeds.

4. **FPGA-Specific Tasks**:
   - **IQ Balancing and Correction**: Corrects imperfections in the RF hardware, such as IQ imbalance and DC offset.
   - **Timing Control**: Handles precise sample timing to align with OAI's real-time processing requirements.
   - **Optional Beamforming**: May implement basic beamforming tasks if the FPGA supports it.

### **Understanding the FPGA's Role**
The FPGA acts as a **bridge between the digital domain (OAI) and the analog/RF domain**. Its tasks ensure the digital IQ samples are ready for RF transmission and that incoming RF signals are correctly converted back to IQ samples for baseband processing.

### **Summary of Signal Flow**
1. **Transmit Path**: OAI PHY → IQ Samples → BladeRF FPGA (Upsampling, DAC, Upconversion) → RF Signal.
2. **Receive Path**: RF Signal → BladeRF FPGA (Downconversion, ADC, Downsampling) → IQ Samples → OAI PHY.

The **FPGA** in the BladeRF board performs critical real-time signal processing tasks that cannot be efficiently managed by a general-purpose CPU or software stack like OAI, given the high sampling rates and tight timing requirements in modern wireless systems.

## upsampling process

In the bladeRF micro x4, the FPGA handles the upsampling of IQ samples during transmission. The upsampling process is implemented within the FPGA’s HDL (Hardware Description Language) code. Specifically, the upsampling functionality is part of the transmit (TX) path, which includes interpolation filters to increase the sample rate of the baseband IQ signals to match the requirements of the RF front-end.

The top-level VHDL file for the bladeRF micro x4 is bladerf.vhd, located in the bladeRF GitHub repository. This file defines the overall architecture and interconnections of the FPGA components. Within this architecture, the transmit path includes modules responsible for upsampling.

The specific modules and their corresponding VHDL files that handle upsampling are:
	1.	Interpolation Filters: These filters increase the sample rate of the input IQ data. The VHDL code for these filters is located in the fir_filter.vhd file within the nuand IP directory.
	2.	Transmit Path Logic: The overall transmit path, including the integration of interpolation filters, is defined in the tx.vhd file.

To locate these files in the repository:
	•	Interpolation Filters: Navigate to the hdl/fpga/ip/nuand/synthesis/ directory to find fir_filter.vhd.
	•	Transmit Path Logic: Navigate to the hdl/fpga/platforms/bladerf-micro/vhdl/ directory to find tx.vhd.

These files collectively implement the upsampling functionality in the bladeRF micro x4’s FPGA design.
